# Html-Tic-Tac-Toe
A science fair project
I've got everything down except for complicated AI. The logic is to always place the first square in a corner then afterwards place squares next to the the player's squares.

3/3/15 IT IS DONE. I have essentially made a GLADOS of Tic-Tac-Toe. From what I can tell, I have reduced the game to a series of steps that can win all the time. Sure, the code for the AI is messy and huge but IT WORKS! 140 lines of AI code.
